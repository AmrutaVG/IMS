# IMS
*It was very nice work nice to work on this project ,which thought me few new things such as how to work on json files etc.

*Basically it gave exposure to file handling, and also to work with non tabulate such as no sql.

*Since it was step by step process it gave proper idea of how things work in the process of inventary management.

*And made design the code in a proper manner and excuete it.

*Few things that have used in code ,understood about json,loads,read,write,close,dumps.....etc

->I have used json files, in the project ,they are record.json and sales.json

    1.record.json ,I used it to read the file and add if any stocks to be added and then bill then the reduced items are updated in record 
   
    2.sales.json  ,I used it after billing what is the sales . 

->the code consist of three parts:

        1.add the items to inventory
        
        2.bill according to purchaser
        
        3.the file is recorded with sales that is made 
         
->project is basically I took how the IMS works in ice cream parlour,

->it consist of product ID, item ,quantity ,amount , expiry date.

->for billing i have used quantity ,item as input and total amount, date ,time.

->And for sales there only need of product id ,quantity , amount ,which i made it get accesed in sales .json.
